# Clawz SG remix out now.

> After his debut on Inlab Recording with the Quasar EP, Clawz SG is now coming back with a newest EP called Leviathan that include 2 originals tracks and 2 remixes. The first track called Leviathan will take you in a deep travel magnified by these melodic leads and pads when the second track called Proteus will go a bit darker with few complex detuned sounds and massive drops As good news never comes alone we have also 2 wonderful remixes: The first one is Leviathan remixed by the well knows French Duo : Willy Real & David Prap, They definitively decided to turn the track into a kicking techno track for the dance floor. The Swedish artist ****Sonic Union****has done the second remix of Leviathan and take a more progressive and groovy direction for it. We are already convinced that this EP will be really fast in your selection for your incoming sets

Support and plays have come from Cid Inc, Hernan Cattaneo, Darin Epsilon, Indieveed and many more!
